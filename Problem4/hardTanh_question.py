         Hints: 
         1. Have a look at the section 3.2 of the CROWN paper [1] (Case Studies) as to how segments are made for multiple activation functions
         2. Look at the HardTanH graph, and see multiple places where the pre activation bounds could be located
         3. Refer the ReLu example in the class and the diagonals to compute the slopes/intercepts
         4. The paper talks about 3 segments S+, S- and S+- for sigmoid and tanh. You should figure your own segments based on preactivation bounds for hardtanh.
